Significance Showcase
=====================

The Significance Showcase is a simple Elasticsearch plugin to easily visualize differences between various significance metrics like mutual information or chi squared.

You can install this plugin to Elasticsearch using this command:

```bin/plugin --url http://hkorte.github.io/significance-showcase/stable.zip --install significance-showcase```

This is the stable release for the current stable Elasticsearch release - and is up-to-date, hopefully ;)
